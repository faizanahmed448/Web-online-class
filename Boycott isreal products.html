    <h1><i>WHY TO BOYCOTT ISREAL PRODUCTS</i></h1>
    <P>Im going to write my views on regarding  why to boycott isreal products.</P>
    <p>As we already know that isreal has killed more than <b>34000</b> since <b>7<sup>th</sup> october 2023</b> in which mostly are childern and women.Israel is a colonial power that controls the life of millions of <strong>Palestinians</strong> against their will and treat them all as <b>“unwanted terrorists”</b> on their own land.Most of the people killed in this war are civilians, including journalists. Israel blames <strong>Hamas</strong> for its recent genocide in the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong>. However, many, including <b><abbr title="united nations">UN</abbr></b> <b>Secretary-General Antonio Guterres</b>, hold that the <strong>Hamas</strong> attacks did not happen in isolation, as they were the result of decades of oppression and occupation.</p>
    <p> We should boycott isreal products because Israel takes tyranny to new heights, jailing children, killing peaceful demonstrators almost on daily basis, uprooting trees, demolishing houses, erecting road blocks, limiting movement, building illegal settlements and keeping settlers outside the law.  if that does not make you to boycott isreal products, nothing will. Apartheid System would not have lasted as long as it did had the old regime been denied the support and collusion of the big powers who looked the other way, as they do now at the plight of the <strong>Palestinians</strong>.</p>
    <h2><i>The <abbr title="Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions">BDS</abbr> Movement Against Israel</i></h2>
    <p><dfn>Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions</dfn> (BDS) is a <strong>Palestinian-led movement</strong> for freedom, justice and equality. <abbr title="Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions">BDS</abbr> upholds the simple principle that <strong>Palestinians</strong> are entitled to the same rights as the rest of humanity.Israel is occupying and colonising <b>Palestinian land</b>, discriminating against <b>Palestinian citizens</b> of Israel and denying <b>Palestinian refugees</b> the right to return to their homes. Inspired by the <b>South African</b> <strong>anti-apartheid movement</strong>, the BDS call urges action to pressure Israel to comply with international law.</p>
    <p><abbr title="Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions"></abbr>BDS is now a vibrant global movement made up of unions, academic associations, churches and grassroots movements across the world. Since its launch in <b>2005</b>, BDS is having a major impact and is effectively challenging international support for Israeli apartheid and <b>settler-colonialism</b>.</p>
    <p>Israel’s technological advancement, its support by the <strong>United States</strong> and some other <strong>European nations</strong>, disharmony among the <strong>Muslim states</strong>, and its weak military strength have coerced the pro-Palestinian people to look for other means to stop Israel’s atrocities. Hence, the call for a boycott of pro-Israel and <strong>Israeli products</strong> has become an effective way to protest against Israel’s massacre in <strong>Palestinian land</strong>.</p>
    
    <p><blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/yasser_arafat_178963?src=t_palestine">The victory march will continue until the Palestinian flag flies in Jerusalem and in all of Palestine.</blockquote></p>
    <p>As <abbr title="Politician">POL</abbr> Fidel Castro said, <q>The Arab population of Palestine are victims of genocidal actions; their lands are confiscated or deprived of water supplies in the semi-desert areas, and their homes are destroyed with heavy wrecking equipment.</q></p>
    <p>As per the above findings: <br>We should boycott isreal producsts and supports our Palestinian brothers and sister to get rid of islreal's occupancy on their <em>land</em>.</p>
    <p>In the last I strongly condem the islreal's illegal occupancy on Palestine and all my prayers, well wishes and suppoort to Palestine <hr>untill my last blood</p>
